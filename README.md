# Production Release Readiness

Evaluate whether a production release has enough operational evidence to proceed.

## Quick start

Run `python3 agent.py example.json` with Python 3.10 or newer. Compare the result with `expected.json`. The JSON keys in the example define the supported input shape.

This offline prototype reads synthetic input and returns a recommendation or diagnostic. It uses no credentials, external APIs, or infrastructure mutations. Results require operator review.

## Local verification

Run `make verify` with Make and Python 3 installed. The sample runs through the CLI and its JSON is compared with `expected.json`.

## Business problem

A deployment needs an accountable owner, rollback drill evidence, and sufficient error budget before an operator can approve it.

## Run the project

### Local setup

Run `make verify` with Python 3 and Make installed.

### CLI usage

```sh
python3 agent.py example.json
```

### Replay usage

Run `make replay` to replay the checked-in inputs. The runner compares stdout with the baseline, reports differences, and exits nonzero on regression.

### Limitations

The verification report covers the bundled local examples. See the [case study](docs/CASE_STUDY.md) for project-specific assumptions and operating limits.
